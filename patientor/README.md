# Exercises 9.8-9.9

## Before you start the exercises

For this set of exercises, you will be developing a backend for an existing project called **Patientor**, which is a simple medical record application for doctors who handle diagnoses and basic health information of their patients.

The [frontend](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor) has already been built by outsider experts and your task is to create a backend to support the existing code.

**WARNING**
Quite often VS code loses track of what is really happening in the code and it shows type or style related warnings despite the code having been fixed. If this happens (to me it has happened quite often), close and open the file that is giving you trouble or just restart the editor. It is also good to doublecheck that everything really works by running the compiler and the ESlint from the command line with commands:

```bash
npm run tsc
npm run lint
```

When run in command line you get the "real result" for sure. So, never trust the editor too much!

## 9.8: Patientor backend, step1

Initialize a new backend project that will work with the frontend. Configure ESlint and tsconfig with the same configurations as proposed in the material. Define an endpoint that answers HTTP GET requests for route `/api/ping`.

The project should be runnable with npm scripts, both in development mode and, as compiled code, in production mode.

## 9.9: Patientor backend, step2

Fork and clone the project [patientor](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/patientor). Start the project with the help of the README file.

You should be able to use the frontend without a functioning backend.

Ensure that the backend answers the ping request that the frontend has made on startup. Check the developer tools to make sure it works:

You might also want to have a look at the console tab. If something fails, [part 3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3) of the course shows how the problem can be solved.

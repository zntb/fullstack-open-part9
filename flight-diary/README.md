# Exercises 9.17-9.20

Let us now build a frontend for the Ilari's flight diaries that was developed in the [previous section](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9/typing_an_express_app). The source code of the backend can be found in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/flight-diary).

## Exercise 9.17

Create a TypeScript React app with similar configurations as the apps of this section. Fetch the diaries from the backend and render those to screen. Do all the required typing and ensure that there are no Eslint errors.

You can decide how the diary entries are rendered. If you wish, you may take inspiration from the figure below. Note that the backend API does not return the diary comments, you may modify it to return also those on a GET request.
